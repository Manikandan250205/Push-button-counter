This project involves designing a simple embedded system using a microcontroller to count and display the number of times a push button is pressed. Since mechanical push buttons suffer from "bouncing," debouncing techniques are necessary to ensure accurate counting. The count will be displayed either on an LCD or a serial monitor.When the push button is pressed, a signal is sent to the microcontroller.
Due to the mechanical nature of buttons, they tend to bounce, causing multiple false detections. A debounce mechanism (software or hardware) ensures only one count per press.The microcontroller processes the input and increments the count.The updated count is displayed on an LCD or printed to the serial monitor.
